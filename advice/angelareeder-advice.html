			<h4>It's okay to step back!</h4>
			<p>Sometimes you will get to a point where you feel like you are banging your head against a wall. </p>

			<p>When this happens its okay to stop and take a break. Even if it is a few days. When you come back your mind will feel clearer and it will be easier to see the problem.</p>

			<h4>Remember if something is off its something you have done along the way. Its okay to go back and double check your work. </h4>
			<p>It's okay to ask for help or look to see if someone else has had this issue and how they solved the problem.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of learning. Its learning by seeing and learning by doing.</p>
